					I am Jake Steven Zimmermann Simmons. 
				I am a PhD student in mathematics at the 
				University of Toronto.
				Currently, I am a student under
				Dr.Joe Repka studying the representation theory
				of lie algebras (although I ususally just 
				study the lie algebras themselves). I am 
				in my forth year.
				Here is my <a id="CVlink" href= "CV/CV.html"> 
				CV</a>.

			<p>
				I contribute a great deal to the 
				culture of the math departement here at 
				the University of Toronto. I am on the 
				social committee of the MGSA. I also 
				also am a go to TA with regard to 
				invalulment in TA panles and TA support.
				I am very experienced with regards to TA 
				observations, and I am happy to lend my 
				expertiese. 
			</p>

			<p>
				When I am not doing math, I am cooking, playing 
				basketball, socializing, making music, 
				or learning about history
				equity, tranportation, 
				and sociology from some podcast. I try my best
				to be as well rounded as I can in my 
				interaction with the world.

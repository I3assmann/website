I would like:

- A 12 month subscription to the awesome socks club
- Zelda: Link's Awakening
- Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
- Arm rests for my couch
- Tickets for Brett Butt (Including train tickets to Belleville) (Feb 1st, Richmond hill)
- Tickets for Nicki Glaser (May 10th) (I only kind of want these since I think I would rather be in Toronto.)
- Tickets for Taylor Tomlinson (Jan 30th, Jan31st, 2 * Feb 1st)
- Tickets for Kumail Nanjani (Feb 8th) (I have now bought these.)
- Tickets for Caravan Palace (April 7th) (I have now bought these.)
- A complete set (or at least some volumes) of the Hunter X Hunter manga. Currently, I have none.
- A high quality fender telecaster
- The berserk manga
- An NES
- A SNES
- New basketball shoes
- Some tailored pants 
- New pants in general that are stylist and professional
- I high quality record player
- A gaming computer with very good specs
- A motorcycle. One that is electric, has a vintage look, and is medium powerful. I don't need anything crazy, but it should be able to get to Parksville on a single charge. The RGNT No.1 classic SE seems like a good option. https://rgnt-motorcycles.com/product/the-no-1-classic-se/

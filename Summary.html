					I am Jake Steven Zimmermann Simmons. 
				I am a PhD student in mathematics at the 
				University of Toronto.
				I am currently researching under 
				Dr.Peter Dukes and I am really enjoying 
				it. I was able to do this research 
				because I won the Student
				Undergraduate Research Award (SURA), 
				competing against students from the 
				whole UVic science faculty. It 
				finished at the end of July
				but I will be able to continue it 
				with a Jamie Cassels Undergraduate 
				Research Award (JCURA) throughout 
				the next year.

					We are looking at a cone in 
				n(n-1)/2 real dimensions where each 
				dimension corresponds to an edge
				weight in the complete graph on n 
				vertices. Specifically we are looking 
				at the cone generated from all
				positive linear combinations of all 
				triangle vectors (i.e the corresponding 
				graph is a triangle).
				We are looking at the facets of this 
				cone, establishing an adjacency between 
				them, and studying it to
				look for possible recursion methods 
				on the cone.

					At the moment my mathematical 
				interests are very broad. I am a 
				huge fan of algebra and analysis 
				and am very excited to learn some 
				topology in the coming year. I really 
				love playing with infinity. I
				also enjoy combinatorics and graph 
				theory.
			</p>

					Recently I attended the Canadian 
				Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 
				(CUMC 2016) at UVic, for which I was 
				on the organising committee.
				It was a really fantastic experience 
				for me. I feel it inspired me and 
				invigorated my passion for math, 
				as is often the case when I spend
				time around driven passionate people.
			</p>
			<p>
					My other interests include music, 
				world building, basketball, and 
				water polo.

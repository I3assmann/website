		As always, I am 
	struggling with my productivity.
	I am sure that this will come up over
	and over as I write in this journal
	but I just can't seem to focus.  I think
	that the main problem is that I not spending 
	enough time outside. I am lingering in one 
	space too long and it is making the days listless
	and boring. Covid obviously doesn't help, but I 
	don't think that is a good excuse not to live 
	my best life. Right now I am focusing on getting
	up earlier, eating better, and staying more
	focused during the day. I think with just a 
	little but composure I will be able to make these
	goals more consistent. I also need to remember to 
	be active and present in the time that I take for
	myself. I don't like just letting time go by, knowing 
	that I have not done enough work that day or that I 
	I am just letting time go by. My life wasting away.
	I can do better. It is spring time. I am feeling very 
	hopeful these days.
